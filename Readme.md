# DSA in TypeScript

This repository aims at providing a collection of data structures and algorithms in TypeScript and C++. Since most of DSA content is in C++ or Java, I thought it would be a good idea to have a repository containing equivalent code in TypeScript. This would help people who are familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript to learn DSA in a language they are comfortable with.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is the go-to language for the modern web. It is a superset of JavaScript and is compiled to JavaScript. It is a strongly typed language and is very similar to C++/Java. It is also very easy to learn and is very beginner friendly. It is also very easy to set up and run. You can learn more about TypeScript [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
